# R A T

## About

So if you found this you are either someone from my server or you found this by searching things... you shouldn't be looking for. Anyway this is a project by me, your local dumbass, and I am trying to make a version of my previous R A T but without using discord. So it will have 2 programs, and maybe a bit more functionality.

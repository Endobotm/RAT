# R A T

## About

So if you found this you are either someone from my server or you found this by searching things... you shouldn't be looking for. Anyway this is a project by me, your local dumbass, and I am trying to make a version of my previous R A T but without using discord. So it will have 2 programs, and maybe a bit more functionality.

## Features

- Key Logger
- Client IPv4 and IPv6
- Remote CMD
- File Uploading and Downloading to/from Client
- FLASHBANG! the Client
- Message Client
- Client Screen View

## The Next Step

I have implemented all the features I initially wanted to implement, and I am quite happy with how it turned out. But I think it could use more features. Why didn't I implement more features? I don't have any more ideas for features. Yea I could have implemented some features from the previous R A T like the camera interface. But thats a bit too far (as if this isn't an invasion of privacy already). But if you have any ideas for features, do let me know and I will implement them!

# R A T

## About

So if you found this you are either someone from my server or you found this by searching things... you shouldn't be looking for. Anyway this is a project by me, your local dumbass, and I am trying to make a version of my previous R A T but without using discord. So it will have 2 programs, and maybe a bit more functionality.

## Pending Features

If you haven't already noticed, this is unfinished, there are a lot more features I want to add and I will list them here, you can just see them, or if you are interested, help complete them.

- IPv4, IPv6, and IPv4 Public Address viewing functionality
- A Map showing the locations of each client on the globe
- Client system information like CPU, GPU, OS, and more
- The Terminal functionality, and maybe a better interface too
- The File Uploader design and implementation
- The File Downloader design and implementation
- A FLASHBANG! feature, that disables keyboard shortcuts, and fills the entire screen with a red or white color.
- New Idea: Splash Screen

Note to Myself: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD FIX YOUR CODE. AND REDUCE ITS SIZE IT IS FUCKING MASSIVE
